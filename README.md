# 16bit_barrel_shifter
Project to build a 16-bit Barrel Shifter using Verilog.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project contains two main .v (verilog) files using which the project runs:
1. barrel_shift_16bit.v
2. tb_barrel_shift_16bit.v

The .c file is created so that we can automate the test cases to the project.
It creates the output file named a.out

The final output is shown using gtkwave. The screenshot of final output is as below:
